Mailback
========

Utility for emailing yourself reports.
Particularly handy for cronjobs.

The report is piped into STDIN.
The subject line comes from the command line arguments.
Everything else (including your email address)
comes from the `~/.mailback` config file.

See the `mailback.1` man-page for more info.
